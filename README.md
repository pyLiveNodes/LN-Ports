# LiveNodes Common Ports

The LiveNodes Common Ports contains a set of standard ports used by almost all LiveNodes packages.

## Ports in this package (TBD)

| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `In_function` | Inputs data generated from a NumPy function into the LiveNodes graph. |
| `In_python`   | Inputs any python data into the LiveNodes graph.                      |

## About LiveNodes
[LiveNodes](https://livenodes.pages.csl.uni-bremen.de/livenodes/index.html) are small units of computation for digital signal processing in python. They are connected multiple synced channels to create complex graphs for real-time applications. Each node may provide a GUI or Graph for live interaction and visualization.

Any contribution is welcome! These projects take more time, than I can muster, so feel free to create issues for everything that you think might work better and feel free to create a MR for them as well!

Have fun and good coding!
